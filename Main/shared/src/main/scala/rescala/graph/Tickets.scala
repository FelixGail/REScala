/* tickets are created by the REScala schedulers, to restrict operations to the correct scopes */

// thoughts regarding now, before and after:
// before: can be used at any time during turns. Thus its parameter should accept implicit turns only.
//         However, we want to be able to invoke .before inside, e.g., the closure of a .fold, where the turn
//         is not present in the scope. Thus before also accepts engines, but dynamically checks, that this engine
//         has a current turn set. This could probably be ensured statically by making sure that every reactive
//         definition site somehow provides the reevaluating ticket as an implicit in the scope, but I'm not sure
//         if this is possible without significant syntactical inconvenience.
//  after: falls under the same considerations as before, with the added exception that it should only accept
//         turns that completed their admission phase and started their propagation phase. This is currently not
//         checked at all, but could also be ensured statically the same as above.
//    now: can be used inside turns only during admission and wrapup, or outside of turns at all times. Since during
//         admission and wrapup, a corresponding OutsidePropagationTicket is in scope, it accepts these tickets as
//         high priority implicit parameters. In case such a ticket is not available, it accepts engines, and then
//         dynamically checks that the engine does NOT have a current turn (in the current thread context). I think
//         this cannot be ensured statically, as users can always hide implicitly available current turns.
